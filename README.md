# valorant_matches
 This script scrapes the VLR.gg website for the most recent matches in Champions Tour Americas and outputs the team names, scores, match date, and link to the match stats.

 I will likely utilize this to create a Discord bot that will post the most recent matches in a channel in the future at some point.
